# Non-Profit Matchmaking Platform – Registration & Organization Interface (NDA Project)

**Note:** This project is under active development and covered by NDA. This README is a portfolio summary; no source code is shared.

## 🌱 Project Overview

This platform supports a global non-profit initiative focused on connecting technical leaders (mentors, advisors, consultants) with non-profit organizations in need of tech expertise. It provides structured onboarding and matching processes to ensure the best fit between parties.

## 👨‍💻 My Role

I’m currently working as **one of two frontend developers** on this ongoing project. My responsibilities include:

- Building and maintaining **interactive, multi-step registration forms** for new users
- Implementing **organization management interfaces**, including data entry, review, and approval flows
- Ensuring **advanced form validation** using `react-hook-form` in combination with `Zod` schemas
- Integrating logic and state with MobX where required
- Working closely with designers and backend developers to align implementation with specs and API structure

The platform was designed with a complete Figma-based UI system, which we follow closely in development.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Core Framework
- **React 18**
- **Vite** + **TypeScript**

### State & Form Handling
- **React Hook Form** + **Zod** – advanced schema-based validation
- **MobX** – state management where reactive stores are required

### UI Framework
- **Mantine UI** – component library used throughout the project
- **Toast UI** – WYSIWYG editor for rich text submissions
- **Day.js**, **clsx**, **qs**

### Developer Tooling
- **Storybook** – component isolation and documentation
- **Jest**, **Testing Library**, **Vitest** – test environments
- **ESLint**, **Prettier**, **SVGO**, **vite-plugin-svgr**

## 🧠 Challenges Addressed

- Built complex forms with conditional rendering, nested validation, and field arrays
- Ensured accessibility and mobile responsiveness across all key views
- Collaborated with UX/UI team to clarify and resolve edge cases in design logic

## 🚀 Status

The platform is actively used by internal testers and is undergoing iterative rollout. Development continues with a focus on polish, onboarding automation, and admin tooling.
