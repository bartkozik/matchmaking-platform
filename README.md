# Non-Profit Matchmaking Platform ‚Äì Registration & Organization Interface (NDA Project)

**Note:** This project is under active development and covered by NDA. This README is a portfolio summary; no source code is shared.

## üå± Project Overview

This platform supports a global non-profit initiative focused on connecting technical leaders (mentors, advisors, consultants) with non-profit organizations in need of tech expertise. It provides structured onboarding and matching processes to ensure the best fit between parties.

## üë®‚Äçüíª My Role

I‚Äôm currently working as **one of two frontend developers** on this ongoing project. My responsibilities include:

- Building and maintaining **interactive, multi-step registration forms** for new users
- Implementing **organization management interfaces**, including data entry, review, and approval flows
- Ensuring **advanced form validation** using `react-hook-form` in combination with `Zod` schemas
- Integrating logic and state with MobX where required
- Working closely with designers and backend developers to align implementation with specs and API structure

- As one of two frontend developers, I regularly worked with the product owner and backend developers to shape form logic and user flows. I had **direct and ongoing contact with the client**, including participation in demo sessions, collaborative discussions, and feedback analysis. I was actively involved in proposing technical solutions to **new or unexpected requirements**, helping translate ideas into feasible implementations within tight timelines.

The project followed Agile methodology with Jira, and collaboration flowed continuously through Figma, Notion, and Slack. My clear communication, strong ownership, and proactive time management were essential in delivering complex, multi-step forms and the organization management interface with consistency and flexibility.

The platform was designed with a complete Figma-based UI system, which we follow closely in development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Core Framework
- **React 18**
- **Vite** + **TypeScript**

### State & Form Handling
- **React Hook Form** + **Zod** ‚Äì advanced schema-based validation
- **MobX** ‚Äì state management where reactive stores are required

### UI Framework
- **Mantine UI** ‚Äì component library used throughout the project
- **Toast UI** ‚Äì WYSIWYG editor for rich text submissions
- **Day.js**, **clsx**, **qs**

### Developer Tooling
- **Storybook** ‚Äì component isolation and documentation
- **Jest**, **Testing Library**, **Vitest** ‚Äì test environments

## üß† Challenges Addressed

- Built complex forms with conditional rendering, nested validation, and field arrays
- Ensured accessibility and mobile responsiveness across all key views
- Collaborated with UX/UI team to clarify and resolve edge cases in design logic

## üöÄ Status

The platform is actively used by internal testers and is undergoing iterative rollout. Development continues with a focus on polish, onboarding automation, and admin tooling.
